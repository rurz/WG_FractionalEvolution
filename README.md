This repository contains the research on the fractional evolution of initial finite and discrete amplitudes over a set of $N$ waveguides with refractive index (graded medium). The aim of this research can be summarized as follow

* Implement a way to obtain the phase-space representation of a classical, and quantum, state given the relation between Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT), Radon Transform (RT), and Wigner function (WF).

* Study the most reliable representation of the FrFT over a set of finite and discrete $N$ points signal. The initial candidates are: $J_{x}$ - coupling, Kravchuk oscillator, and Harper functions.

* Optimize the procedure for bigger $N$, representing overcomplete state, with entanglement
